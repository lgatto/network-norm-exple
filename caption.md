Figure X illustrates the effect of centering and scaling on a simple
and tractable network of 5 genes: (a) genes 1 and 2 are random (in
gray), genes 3 and 4 are co-expressed (in steel-blue), and gene 5 (in
light blue) has an expression close, in absolute expression intensity,
to gene 3. The width of the graph edges and the layout of the graphs
(c, e, f) (i.e. proximity of the nodes) are proportional to the
similarity of the nodes/genes. Heatmap (b) and graph (c) represent the
euclidean distances and the resulting network, illustrating the
similarity of genes 3 and 5 when the distance of absolute expression
values are used. After centering and scaling of the expression values,
we see how the co-expressed genes become closely connected (d, e). At
the bottom (f, g), we represent the result of calculating gene
expression correlation as a positive control, demonstrating the
desired effect directly on the absolute expression values. The nodes
of genes 3 and 4 nearly fully overlap.
