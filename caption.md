Figure X illustrates the effect of centering and scaling on a simple
and tractable network of 5 genes: genes 1 and 2 are random (in gray),
genes 3 and 4 are co-expressed (in steel-blue), and gene 5 (in light
blue) has an expression close, in absolute expression intensity, to
gene 3. The width of the graph edges and the layout of the graph
(i.e. proximity of the nodes) are proportional to the similarity of
the nodes. The first set of heatmap and graph represent the euclidean
distances and the resulting network, illustrating the absolute
similarity of genes 3 and 5 using the distance of absolute expression
values. After centering and scaling of the expression values, we see
how the co-expressed genes become closely connected. At the bottom, we
represent the result of calculating gene expression correlation as a
positive control, demonstrating the desired effect directly on the
absolute expression values.
